  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>Surfing is a surface water sport in which the wave rider, referred to as a surfer, rides on the forward or deep
    face of a moving wave, which is usually carrying the surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are
    primarily found in the ocean, but can also be found in lakes or in rivers in the form of a standing wave or tidal
    bore. However, surfers can also utilize artificial waves such as those from boat wakes and the waves created in
    artificial wave pools.</p>

    The term surfing refers to the act of riding a wave, regardless of whether the wave is ridden with a board or
    without a board, and regardless of the stance used (goofy or regular stance). The native peoples of the Pacific, for
    instance, surfed waves on alaia, paipo, and other such craft, and did so on their belly and knees. The modern-day
    definition of surfing, however, most often refers to a surfer riding a wave standing up on a surfboard; this is also
    referred to as stand-up surfing.</p>
